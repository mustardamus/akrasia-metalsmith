        Hi! I am Basti, 29 years old, originally from Germany. Welcome to my
        digital shelter. Here you will find information about the most prominent
        parts of my life, that is <a href="/skills">coding</a> &amp;
        <a href="/pictures">traveling</a>. I even sometimes
        <a href="/posts">blog</a> about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course there is so much more going on in my life, I rode BMX for over
        a decade, I recently picked up mixing some music, mostly Drum &amp; Bass
        , which I love and go dancing to regularly for the same time I started
        travelling - for almost 4 years.
      </p>

        If you want to know more, or just want to say hello, or need some help
        with your web-project - feel free to <a href="/contact">contact</a> me
        anytime. Thanks for stopping by!
